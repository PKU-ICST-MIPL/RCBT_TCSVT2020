# Introduction
This is the source code of our CVPR 2019 paper "Reinforced Cross-Media Correlation Learning by Context-Aware Bidirectional Translation". Please cite the following paper if you use our code.

Yuxin Peng and Jinwei Qi, "Reinforced Cross-Media Correlation Learning by Context-Aware Bidirectional Translation", IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT), Vol. 30, No. 6, pp. 1718-1731, Jun. 2020.(SCI, EI)

# Dependency

This code is implemented with tensorflow (1.9.0).

# Data Preparation

The input of the codes is the features extrected from the pre-trained model, which have been disscussed in our paper.

You can download the extrected features on XMediaNet dataset in this paper with the following lins:
